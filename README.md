# ENIGMA-LIKE ENCRYPTION PROGRAM

A C PROGRAM THAT IMPLEMENTS AN ENIGMA-STYLE ENCRYPTION SYSTEM USING MULTIPLE BARREL ROTORS FOR TEXT ENCRYPTION AND
DECRYPTION.

## DESCRIPTION

THIS PROGRAM IMPLEMENTS A TEXT ENCRYPTION SYSTEM INSPIRED BY THE ENIGMA MACHINE, USING THREE CONFIGURABLE BARRELS (ROTORS) AND A REFLECTOR. IT PROCESSES INPUT TEXT THROUGH MULTIPLE ENCRYPTION STAGES TO PRODUCE A SECURE ENCRYPTED
OUTPUT.

## INSTALLATION

USING CMAKE (RECOMMENDED):

1. CONFIGURE AND BUILD
   ```BASH
   CMAKE -S . -B BUILD
   CMAKE --BUILD BUILD
   ```
2. INSTALL
   ```BASH
   SUDO CMAKE --INSTALL BUILD
   ```
   - THE EXECUTABLE WILL BE INSTALLED TO: /USR/LOCAL/BIN/ENIGMA (DEFAULT PREFIX)
   - THE DATA FILES FROM ./BIN (BARRELS_BIN, MODIFIERS_BIN) WILL BE INSTALLED TO: ~/.LOCAL/SHARE/ENIGMA

NOTES:
- IF YOU PREFER A DIFFERENT SYSTEM PREFIX, SET IT WHEN CONFIGURING, FOR EXAMPLE:
  ```BASH
  CMAKE -S . -B BUILD -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/USR/LOCAL
  ```
- YOU CAN ALSO INSTALL WITHOUT SUDO BY CHOOSING A WRITABLE PREFIX (E.G., YOUR HOME):
  ```BASH
  CMAKE -S . -B BUILD -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/.LOCAL"
  CMAKE --BUILD BUILD
  CMAKE --INSTALL BUILD
  # ENSURE ~/.LOCAL/BIN IS IN YOUR PATH
  ```

## USAGE

COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS:

```
 ENIGMA [OPTIONS]

 OPTIONS:
   -H, --HELP           SHOW THIS HELP AND EXIT
   -V, --VERSION        SHOW VERSION INFORMATION AND EXIT
   -F, --FILE <PATH>    INPUT FILE TO PROCESS (REQUIRED)
   -O, --OUTPUT <PATH>  OUTPUT FILE PATH (DEFAULT: OUTPUT.TXT)
   -L, --LEVEL <N>      SECURITY LEVEL: 1=LOW, 2=HIGH, 3=EXTREME
   -D, --DECRYPT        DECRYPT MODE (DEFAULT IS ENCRYPT)
```

EXAMPLES:
- ENCRYPT WITH LEVEL 2:
  ```BASH
  ENIGMA -F INPUT.TXT -O OUT.TXT -L 2
  ```
- DECRYPT:
  ```BASH
  ENIGMA --DECRYPT --FILE CIPHER.TXT --OUTPUT PLAIN.TXT
  ```

DATA FILES SEARCH ORDER FOR BARRELS/MODIFIERS:
1) RELATIVE: ../BIN/{BARRELS_BIN, MODIFIERS_BIN}
2) USER: $HOME/.LOCAL/SHARE/ENIGMA/{BARRELS_BIN, MODIFIERS_BIN}
3) SYSTEM: /USR/LOCAL/SHARE/ENIGMA/{BARRELS_BIN, MODIFIERS_BIN}

NOTES BELOW DESCRIBE THE ALGORITHMIC BEHAVIOR. THE ENCRYPTED OUTPUT WILL INCLUDE THREE CHARACTERS AT THE END REPRESENTING THE BARREL POSITIONS USED FOR ENCRYPTION.

## CONFIGURATION

THE BARREL SETTINGS CAN BE CONFIGURED IN THE DEFINES.H FILE:

- BARREL_A: FIRST ROTOR POSITION (1–26)
- BARREL_B: SECOND ROTOR POSITION (1–26)
- BARREL_C: THIRD ROTOR POSITION (1–26)

ALL BARREL VALUES MUST BE BETWEEN 1 AND 26 TO REPRESENT VALID LETTER SHIFTS.

## HOW IT WORKS

1. INPUT TEXT IS CONVERTED TO UPPERCASE
2. EACH CHARACTER PASSES THROUGH:
    - BARREL A ENCRYPTION AND ROTATION
    - BARREL B ENCRYPTION AND ROTATION
    - BARREL C ENCRYPTION AND ROTATION
    - REFLECTOR
    - REVERSE PATH THROUGH ALL BARRELS
3. THE FINAL OUTPUT INCLUDES THE BARREL POSITIONS AS VALIDATION KEYS
